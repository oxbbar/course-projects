## Setup

Install and load the required packages.
``` {r results='hide', message=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("tidyr",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("ggplot2",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("lubridate",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("readr",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("janitor",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("styler",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("plotly",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(styler)
library(plotly)
```

Create a list of csv files in the directory.
``` {r}
files_csv <- list.files(path = "bellabeat_data/", pattern = "*.csv")
```

Create a list of file names for the data frames.
``` {r}
files <- substr(files_csv,1,nchar(files_csv)-4)
```

Create data frames for all the csv files.
``` {r results='hide', message=FALSE}
for(i in files){
  filepath = file.path(paste("bellabeat_data/",i,".csv", sep = ""))
  assign(i,read_csv(filepath))
}
```

Count the distinct IDs in each data frame to determine how many individuals there were for each data set.
``` {r}
n_distinct(dailyActivity_merged$Id)
n_distinct(dailyCalories_merged$Id)
n_distinct(dailyIntensities_merged$Id)
n_distinct(dailySteps_merged$Id)
n_distinct(heartrate_seconds_merged$Id)
n_distinct(hourlyCalories_merged$Id)
n_distinct(hourlyIntensities_merged$Id)
n_distinct(hourlySteps_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteCaloriesWide_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteIntensitiesWide_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteMETsNarrow_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteSleep_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteStepsNarrow_merged$Id)
n_distinct(minuteStepsWide_merged$Id)
n_distinct(sleepDay_merged$Id)
n_distinct(weightLogInfo_merged$Id)
```

All data sets had 33 individuals, except for:
- heartrate_seconds = 14
- minuteSleep = 24
- sleepDay = 24
- WeightLogInfo = 8

### Processing the Daily Activity Data

Determine how the data is structured.
``` {r}
str(dailyActivity_merged)
```

Check for NA values and duplicate rows.
``` {r}
sum(is.na(dailyActivity_merged))
sum(duplicated(dailyActivity_merged))
```

Clean the column names.
``` {r}
dailyActivity_merged <- clean_names(dailyActivity_merged)
glimpse(dailyActivity_merged)
```

Add a new date column in appropriate format, column for day of the week (with Monday being designated as the first day) and an "id_and_date" to use as reference for joins later.
``` {r}
dailyActivity_merged <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  mutate(
    new_date = as.Date(activity_date,"%m/%d/%y"),
    week_day = wday(new_date,label=TRUE,week_start=1),
    id_and_date = paste0(id,"_and_",new_date)
  )
str(dailyActivity_merged)
```

### Processing the Daily Sleep Data

Determine how the data is structured.
``` {r}
str(sleepDay_merged)
```

Check for NA values and duplicate rows.
``` {r}
sum(is.na(sleepDay_merged))
sum(duplicated(sleepDay_merged))
```

Remove duplicates.
``` {r}
sleepDay_merged <- sleepDay_merged[!duplicated(sleepDay_merged),]
sum(duplicated(sleepDay_merged))
```

Clean the column names.
``` {r}
sleepDay_merged <- clean_names(sleepDay_merged)
str(sleepDay_merged)
```

Add a new column for time awake in bed, a new date column in appropriate format, column for day of the week (with Monday being designated as the first day) and an "id_and_date" to use as reference for joins later.
``` {r}
sleepDay_merged <- sleepDay_merged %>%
  mutate(
    time_awake_in_bed = total_time_in_bed - total_minutes_asleep,
    new_date = as.Date(sleep_day,"%m/%d/%y"),
    week_day = wday(new_date,label=TRUE,week_start=1),
    id_and_date = paste0(id,"_and_",new_date)
  )
str(sleepDay_merged)
```

### Processing the Daily Weight Data

Determine how the data is structured.
``` {r}
str(weightLogInfo_merged)
```

Check for NA values and duplicate rows.
``` {r}
sum(is.na(weightLogInfo_merged))
sum(duplicated(weightLogInfo_merged))
```

NA values exist - double check what they actually are.
``` {r}
head(weightLogInfo_merged)
```
They are just 'Fat' records that weren't put in, but other daily data exists for these dates and, if we need, we can filter out these NA vales if we analyse Fat data.

Clean the column names.
``` {r}
weightLogInfo_merged <- clean_names(weightLogInfo_merged)
str(weightLogInfo_merged)
```

Add a new date column in appropriate format, column for day of the week and an "id_and_date" to use as reference for joins later.
``` {r}
weightLogInfo_merged <- weightLogInfo_merged %>%
  mutate(
    new_date = as.Date(date,"%m/%d/%y"),
    week_day = wday(new_date,label=TRUE),
    id_and_date = paste0(id,"_and_",new_date)
  )
str(weightLogInfo_merged)
```

### Creating temp tables for joining

Daily Activity Data.
``` {r}
colnames(dailyActivity_merged)
```
``` {r}
temp_daily_activity <- select(dailyActivity_merged, 
  "id", 
  "new_date",
  "id_and_date",
  "total_steps", 
  "total_distance", 
  "very_active_distance",
  "moderately_active_distance",
  "light_active_distance",
  "sedentary_active_distance",
  "very_active_minutes",
  "fairly_active_minutes",
  "lightly_active_minutes",
  "sedentary_minutes",
  "calories", 
  "week_day"
  )
```

Daily Sleep Data.
``` {r}
colnames(sleepDay_merged)

  "id_and_date",
  "total_sleep_records",
  "time_awake_in_bed",
  "total_minutes_asleep",
  "total_time_in_bed",
  )
```

Merge these two data frames with an outer join.
``` {r}

str(merged_daily_activity_and_sleep)
```

Daily Weight Data.
``` {r}
colnames(weightLogInfo_merged)
```
``` {r}

  "id_and_date",
  "weight_kg",
  "weight_pounds",
  "fat",
  "bmi",
  "is_manual_report",
  )
colnames(temp_daily_weight)
```

Merge all data together.
``` {r}
merged_data_daily <- merge(x = merged_daily_activity_and_sleep, y = temp_daily_weight, by = "id_and_date", all = TRUE)
str(merged_data_daily)
glimpse(merged_data_daily)
